Note: We identifed programs in the O.M.B. instructions by their assistance listing number, then used program titles and obligation totals for the most recent complete fscal year, 2024, from the government’s System for Award Management website. Money obligated in a certain year doesn’t have to be spent that year, which means obligations don’t translate directly into money out the door. For the tax credit programs, data refects total expenditures for the 2024 fscal year. Figures are rounded. By our count, the O.M.B.'s list of programs included every entry but four in the federal System for Award Management database, including many expired programs.
